            The Institute for Peace and Democracy (IPD) was inaugurated by the President of the Republic of Indonesia in conjunction with the inauguration of the first Bali Democracy Forum on 10 December 2008.
The IPD serves as the official partner of the Bali Democracy Forum. Its role among others is to provide academic and technical support, within the framework of cooperation in capacity building, joint research, and network-building, for democratic communities in the region.
